# üñ•Ô∏è Day 5 - Disk Partitioning (SysAdmin Lab)

## üìå Objective
Learn how to **partition disks** in Windows Server or Windows OS using PowerShell.  
A system administrator needs this skill to organize storage, improve performance, and manage data effectively.

---

## üí° Why We Use Disk Partitioning
- **Organization:** Keep OS, software, and user data separate.
- **Security:** Isolate sensitive data from other files.
- **Backup efficiency:** Easier to back up specific partitions.
- **Multi-boot systems:** Install different operating systems on the same physical drive.
- **Performance:** Separate frequently used files from rarely used ones.

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands for Partitioning

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Run all commands in PowerShell as Administrator** (Right‚Äëclick ‚Üí Run as Administrator).

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Available Disks and Volumes
```powershell
Get-Disk
Get-Volume
Purpose: Lists all disks and their current partitions.
Run in: PowerShell (Admin).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Partition
powershell
Copy
Edit
New-Partition -DiskNumber 0 -UseMaximumSize -AssignDriveLetter
Purpose: Creates a new partition on Disk 0 using all available unallocated space.
Run in: PowerShell (Admin).
Note: Replace 0 with the correct disk number.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Format a Partition
powershell
Copy
Edit
Format-Volume -DriveLetter E -FileSystem NTFS -NewFileSystemLabel "DataDrive"
Purpose: Formats the E: drive with NTFS and names it "DataDrive".
Run in: PowerShell (Admin).
Common Error:

Access Denied ‚Üí You didn‚Äôt run as Administrator or the drive is in use.

Fix: Close all programs using the drive and retry.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Resize an Existing Partition
powershell
Copy
Edit
Resize-Partition -DriveLetter D -Size 50GB
Purpose: Resizes the D: drive to 50 GB.
Run in: PowerShell (Admin).

‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions Before Partitioning
Backup your data before making changes.

Move important files from the target partition to a safe location.

Ensure enough free space exists before resizing.

Never format a drive that still has data you need.

üßë‚Äçüíª What a SysAdmin Does in Real Jobs
When a system administrator manages storage:

Creates separate partitions for:

Operating system

User profiles/data

Applications

Backups

Expands or shrinks partitions when storage needs change.

Migrates data from one disk to another.

Monitors disk health to prevent failures.

üîÑ Different Ways to Partition Disks
1Ô∏è‚É£ Using PowerShell
(What we are learning here)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Using Disk Management GUI
text
Copy
Edit
Press Win + R ‚Üí Type: diskmgmt.msc
3Ô∏è‚É£ Using Command Prompt (diskpart)
cmd
Copy
Edit
diskpart
list disk
select disk 0
create partition primary size=50000
format fs=ntfs label="DataDrive" quick
4Ô∏è‚É£ Using Third-Party Tools
EaseUS Partition Master

MiniTool Partition Wizard

AOMEI Partition Assistant

These tools provide:

Easier graphical interfaces

Data migration features

Partition recovery options

üìÖ Real-Life Applications
Separate OS from personal data for easier OS reinstallation.

Create a partition for backups to avoid mixing them with active files.

Dual-boot systems (e.g., Windows + Linux) on the same physical disk.

Allocate storage for specific projects or clients in workplaces.

üö´ Disadvantages of Partitioning
Wasted space if partitions are not sized properly.

Reduced flexibility ‚Äî resizing later can be risky.

Data loss risk if done without backups.

Misconfiguration can make the system unbootable.

üìù Why We Are Doing This Process
In this lab:

We simulate what a system administrator would do in a new server setup.

We learn both PowerShell automation and manual disk management.

We prepare for real-world tasks like storage upgrades and disk migrations.
