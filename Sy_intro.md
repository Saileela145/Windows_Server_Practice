# System Administrator:
"System Administrator is responsible for installing,configuring(to arrange) and maintaining the hardware and software systems of an organization.They manage servers,user accounts,security and networks to ensure smooth and secure IT operations.

For example,in a college or company ,a System Administrator installs OpeartingSystems on computers,manages internet access,creates user login IDs,handle backups,and ensures that all systems are secure and up-to-date.

If any technical issue occurs‚Äîlike a network problem, system crash, or security alert‚Äîthe System Administrator quickly troubleshoots and resolves it to minimize downtime.

As a B.Tech student, I‚Äôve developed a strong interest in system administration and have started practicing with tools like VirtualBox, Windows Server, and basic Linux commands to understand how real-world IT systems work.‚Äù
